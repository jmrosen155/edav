Plan for your team to take 20 minutes, because there will be transition time and setup and questions and answers. We have the luxury of an additional day (Thursday, 30 April) into which we might spill over, in signup order, but let's try not to. This is a rough outline of what to prepare for project presentations.

1. A *very brief* introduction to the data space: what kinds of issues are we looking at, the 60 second version.
1. A link for us to explore on our own. This may contain a mix of code, writeup, data. 
1. Demo. Show us what worked. What did you learn about the data from doing this?
1. Code review (2): at least two people should show us something they implemented (can be part of demo above) and discuss the implementation. Show what you learned how to do that you didn't know before doing it here. You might include something that doesn't work to solicit feedback or suggestions on it from the class.
1. What's left? What would be next steps from here? A notes/todo document would be helpful.

Through the presentation or your supplemental materials like a readme, we should get a sense of how your team organized and specialized.
